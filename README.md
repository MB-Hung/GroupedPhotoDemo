# grouped_photo

@A simulated grouped photo list .

    -Provide a button that, when clicked, generates a random list with 30 items.
        Each item should consist of a header (fixed height, title is item index) and content (random height, but at least 1/4 of the screen height, content can be left blank).

    -While scrolling, the header of the topmost item should stick to the top of the screen (similar to flutter_sticky_header).
    -the list should be scrollable using a scrollbar, allowing scrolling to the first or last item.

    During the scrolling process, the scrollbar should indicate the current index of the item being browsed (similar to draggable_scrollbar).
